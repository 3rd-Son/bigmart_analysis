# BigMart Outlet Sales Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the outlet sales of a supermarket chain named "BigMart" using various regression algorithms. The dataset used for analysis contains the following features:

- `Item_Identifier`: Unique identifier for each item in the inventory.
- `Item_Weight`: Weight of the item.
- `Item_Fat_Content`: Categorical variable indicating whether the item is low fat or regular.
- `Item_Visibility`: The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular item.
- `Item_Type`: Categorical variable indicating the category of the item.
- `Item_MRP`: Maximum Retail Price (price at which the item is sold to customers) of the item.
- `Outlet_Identifier`: Unique identifier for each outlet/store.
- `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: The year in which the outlet was established.
- `Outlet_Size`: Categorical variable indicating the size of the outlet.
- `Outlet_Location_Type`: Categorical variable indicating the type of location where the outlet is situated.
- `Outlet_Type`: Categorical variable indicating the type of outlet.
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`: The sales of the item in the particular outlet (target variable).
- `source`: Indicates whether the data point is from the training set or the test set.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to develop regression models that can accurately predict the outlet sales for the BigMart supermarket chain. The models will be trained using the provided dataset, and their performance will be evaluated based on their ability to predict the sales accurately.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Perform an initial exploration of the dataset to gain insights into the features and their relationships. Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary preprocessing steps like encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant information from the available features or create new features that might help improve the model's predictive power. This could involve techniques like binning, creating interaction variables, or deriving statistical features.

3. **Model Development**: Utilize various regression algorithms from the `sklearn` library to develop predictive models. Some of the algorithms that can be considered include XGBoost Regressor, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor. Train the models on the training data and tune hyperparameters if required.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. Compare the performance of different models and identify the best-performing one.

5. **Prediction and Deployment**: Once the best model is identified, use it to make predictions on the test dataset. Prepare the submission file in the required format. If necessary, save the trained model for future use.
